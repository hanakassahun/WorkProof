 # WorkProof

**Portable, evidence-backed collaboration reputations.**

WorkProof is a platform designed to make teamwork more transparent by helping teams verify contributions, build trust faster, and carry credible proof of work across projects.

---

## The Problem

In student teams, freelance projects, and open-source collaborations, it is often difficult to verify who actually contributed meaningful work.

Resumes can be exaggerated. Git commits don’t always reflect impact. Recommendations are subjective. As a result, teams frequently make decisions based on assumptions rather than evidence.

This lack of transparency creates friction when forming teams and evaluating collaborators.

---

## The Solution

WorkProof generates verifiable collaboration reputations by analyzing project activity and validating individual contributions.

Instead of relying on claims, teams can make informed decisions based on transparent proof of work.

WorkProof shifts collaboration from **trust-based** to **evidence-based**.
